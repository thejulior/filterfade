DESCRIPTION
This script is meant for a gallery page where there are multiple similarly displayed
elements with a mix of meta-types. A bar of clickable filter buttons is meant to be
displayed prominently. These will fade out of view temporarily as the gallery elements
for a selected filter type are laid out. There's also the option of filtering a footer
element with the script to prevent it from jumping around as the page size adjusts.
I originally wrote this to work with the colorbox plugin, so that works nicely.

More detailed instructions are included as comments in the .js file.
